# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-CNN
The project addresses the pressing challenge 
of manual brain tumor diagnosis through the development of an automated system using 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In the context of abnormal cell growth in the brain, 
timely detection is paramount. The conventional method, relying on radiologists' meticulous 
analysis of MRI scans, is not only time-intensive but prone to errors. To solve this serious issue 
and leverage the power of CNNs, the project aims to create a robust model capable of classifying 
brain MRI images
The dataset known as the "Brain Tumor MRI Dataset" comprises 7023 MRI images of the 
human brain, categorized into four groups: glioma, meningioma, no tumor, and pituitary. Gliomas 
arise from glial cells in the brain and spinal cord, whereas meningiomas are generally benign 
tumors originating from the meninges, the protective layers enveloping the brain and spinal cord. 
Pituitary tumors form in the pituitary gland, impacting hormone regulation.
The dataset has been divided into Training and Testing sets, comprising 5712 images 
assigned to the training set and 1311 images to the test set. Furthermore, the training set is stratified 
across four classes: glioma (1312 images), meningioma (1339 images), no tumor (1595 images), 
and pituitary (1457 images).
